# Smart Portfolio Generator

Welcome to the **Smart Portfolio Generator**! This project is a Python-based stock portfolio management tool, designed to help users generate a customized stock portfolio based on their preferences and financial profile.

## Features

- **Stock Data Fetching:** Get stock data from various sectors like Tech, Healthcare, Finance, Energy, and Consumer Goods.
- **Risk Assessment:** The app calculates a risk score based on user inputs like marital status, age, number of children, retirement plans, and debt.
- **Portfolio Generation:** Generate a portfolio based on your risk score, sector preferences, and more.
- **Visualization:** View sector distribution through pie charts and stock price trends via graphs.
- **Export to CSV:** Save your generated portfolio to a CSV file for later use.
- **Theme Customization:** Switch between light and dark modes for better visual experience.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- Matplotlib (for charting)
- Requests (for fetching stock data)
- JSON (for profile storage)
- CSV (for exporting data)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

```
requests
matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-portfolio-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd smart-portfolio-generator
```

3. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - **Mac/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the app by executing the `gui.py` file.

```bash
python gui.py
```

2. The program will ask you to fill in your profile (age, marital status, children, etc.) and then generate a personalized stock portfolio based on your preferences.
3. Once the portfolio is generated, you can view a chart showing the distribution of sectors in your portfolio.
4. You can save the portfolio to a CSV file and even switch between light and dark mode for the interface.

## File Structure

- **login.py**: Handles the profile creation and login process.
- **gui.py**: Main application file that runs the Smart Portfolio Generator.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of required Python packages.
- **MegaJunk.java**: (optional) A large junk file for testing purposes, to simulate unnecessary files in a project.

## Known Issues and Problems

Here are some known issues and limitations with the current version of the Smart Portfolio Generator:

### 1. **Stock Data Fetching Delays**
   - **Issue:** Stock data is fetched from the Polygon.io API, and sometimes requests may time out or be delayed due to network or API limitations.
   - **Solution:** The app handles errors by skipping failed stock fetches, but a more graceful error message could be added for the user.
  
### 2. **Limited Stock Sectors**
   - **Issue:** The available stock sectors (Tech, Healthcare, Finance, Energy, Consumer) are hardcoded, which may not represent the full stock market spectrum.
   - **Solution:** Future versions could allow users to add custom sectors or load them dynamically from external sources.

### 3. **Non-Responsive User Interface (UI) in Certain Cases**
   - **Issue:** When generating a portfolio or fetching stock data, the app may freeze momentarily due to long-running tasks (especially with slow internet or large datasets).
   - **Solution:** Implementing threading or using an asynchronous approach could improve responsiveness during data fetches and calculations.

### 4. **Data Accuracy**
   - **Issue:** This data is not reflective of actual market conditions.
   - **Solution:** Integrating a more reliable data source or using real-time data for all financial indicators would improve the accuracy of the portfolio recommendations.

### 5. **Limited Error Handling**
   - **Issue:** There is limited error handling when a user provides invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values for debt amount or age).
   - **Solution:** More robust validation could be implemented, such as error messages that specify the type of incorrect input.

### 6. **Graphical Glitches**
   - **Issue:** The pie chart and stock graphs may sometimes fail to display properly if the data is incomplete or there is a rendering issue with Matplotlib.
   - **Solution:** Review the Matplotlib configuration and handle edge cases where data might be incomplete.

### 7. **Limited CSV Export Format**
   - **Issue:** The CSV export functionality only includes a small subset of data (ticker, sector, score, etc.) and doesn't allow for custom data selection.
   - **Solution:** Future versions could include additional customization options for CSV export, such as selecting specific columns or data fields.
